// When we do `orders.push(order)`, the ownership of the value is moved into the `orders` vector.
// This means we can't use the `order` variable again after that line.
// To solve this, we can clone the order *before* moving it, or we can retrieve it from the vector after pushing.
// The updated code now retrieves the last added order to return it.
// Additionally, for robust error handling, `unwrap()` should be replaced with proper error handling in a real application.
// For this simple example, it's fine.
// The `OrderItem` and `Order` structs now also derive `Serialize` so they can be returned as JSON.
